Here's what we've been up to since we published Curse Bound earlier this year:

Rebecca completed an adult fantasy/humour novel, working title: The Witch's Diary. Our first-readers have provided feedback and she's gearing up to query it.

Adriaan completed a YA low-fantasy novel with a gender-fluid theme, working title: Part Time Girl. He has been querying it and has had some partials requested.

We have not forgotten the Mist Warden series! We recently completed the outline for book 3: Death Bound. There's death and mayhem in Coldwater as the gate's magic pushes farther into this reality. Jess, Drew, and Mac face the toughest challenges yet, making decisions that will change the course of history.

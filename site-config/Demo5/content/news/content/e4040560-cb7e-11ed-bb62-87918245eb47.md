For a while, I've had this vague idea for a quirky, gender-bending story about a royal child, and the guard assigned to protect them from assassination. When I saw the call for the 'Askew' series of Anthologies, I thought, here's a venue that might appreciate my quirky story idea, and I was right!

"Broken Bonds" is the first short story I've been able to place in an anthology. I'm excited to get my name out there!

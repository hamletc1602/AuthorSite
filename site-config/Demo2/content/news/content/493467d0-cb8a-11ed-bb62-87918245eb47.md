My fantasy novel, The Witch’s Diary, has found a home with [Tyche Books](www.tychebooks.com) and I couldn’t be more excited! It is scheduled for release in 2020. This book was so much fun to write and we know that it is going to get even better in the talented hands of this fantastic publisher.

This book started as a side project, for me to clear my mind when struggling through some chapters of Chaos Bound (the very first book Adriaan and I wrote together). I never expected to finish it, let alone pull it together into the wild and soul-mending journey that Hester goes through, but I'm super glad I was able to invest the time it deserved.

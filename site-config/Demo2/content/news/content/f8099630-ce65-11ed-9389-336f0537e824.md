I am over-the-moon excited to announce that there is now an audiobook version of The Witch's Diary! Tyche Books organized this amazing unabridged edition which is narrated by Tara Yelle.

Themes of diversity and disability are woven throughout this novel, so it was particularly important to myself and Tyche Books that it be accessible to as many readers as possible. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did! There's nothing quite like hearing your written words spoken aloud in someone else's voice. Tara Yelle did a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life.

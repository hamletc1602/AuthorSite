I'm not a huge fan of hand-selling books. In general I prefer the comfy silences of the internet for connecting with readers, but the indomitable Sandy Fitzpatrick organized a multi-author table for this year's Calgary Comic Expo, and felt I should give it a try.

I learned that I'm exactly as awkward at enticing people to look at a table full of books as I expected, but it was kind of fun too. And, we ended up selling four Chaos Bound, and one Curse Bound, to a reader excited enough about the premise to buy both books in the series at once!

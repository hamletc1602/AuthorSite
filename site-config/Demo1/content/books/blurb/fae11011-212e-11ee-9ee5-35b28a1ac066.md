The Author Organizer is the permanent partner to the Author Planner, where you schedule project time using undated monthly and weekly sheets. 

Here, you will record data and reminders that need to be kept from year to year. Whether you need to quickly double check where you published a novel, forgot your username on a social media platform, or have to contact support because your word processor has stopped working, this organizer will have you covered (once you fill it out).

Inside are sheets to manage information related to published works, corporate tasks, reoccurring expenses, platforms, software, equipment, and contacts. Event packing lists ensure you will always remember to bring important items to conferences, readings, and signings. For authors who self-publish, there is also a publishing checklist to log completed steps.

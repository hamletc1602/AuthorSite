Stay focused and organized with one location for scheduling and tracking important writing and publishing data. No more headaches searching for details across multiple vendors, computers, and binders. 

This is the yearly planner companion to the permanent Author Organizer, where you record data and reminders that need to be kept over multiple years.

The layouts are simple with minimal clutter, only including sheets to track data that most authors find useful. It is undated to accommodate interruptions, allowing authors to plan their writing schedule around other work and life responsibilities. Whether you have a solid week or month to write, or you have an hour a day, this planner will work for you.

Inside you can set goals and create yearly/monthly/weekly plans. Pages to track the progress of all your projects, deadlines, submissions, marketing campaigns, inventory, and budget give you straightforward overviews to keep you informed and focused on priority tasks.

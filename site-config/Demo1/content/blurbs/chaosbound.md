Jessica never thought it would go this far. Here she was, trapped in her own basement with a monster who’d already eaten one of her friends and couldn’t wait to sink its shadowy claws into her.

She wasn’t anyone’s idea of a hero--a bookish computer nerd in way over her head.

If she’d just ignored the visions. Ignored the way the laws of physics seemed to be wavering. Ignored the voice of the Gatekeeper inside her head showing her the arcane secrets of magic, she could be blissfully ignorant of the death and pain stalking her small town.

But you can’t look away once you’ve seen real evil.

She'd been shunned by her (former) best friends. Her name was a joke at school. Her parents thought she was either already on drugs, or should be. And, her only allies were just as fragile and confused as her.

There's one thing this killer from the past hadn’t counted on...

When the going gets weird, the tough are useless. You need a geek.

Pirates! Cats! It doesn't get any better than that!

I was immediately psyched by the concept for Swashbuckling Cats and knew I had to contribute a story, but what? Then an idea emerged. A story of suspense, revenge, bloodshed, and daring on the high seas. A pirate with a soft heart and a lost soul in need of healing.

My story turned out far better than I expected (with a little help from Adriaan on the one action sequence - He doesn't even like action movies, but he's got a knack for action scenes) and I'm so glad it was selected to be part of this awesome anthology so you can all read it.

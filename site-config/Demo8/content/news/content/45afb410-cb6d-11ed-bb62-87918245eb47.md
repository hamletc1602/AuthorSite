We have both (Rebecca and Adriaan) had a 'drabble' ( a 100 word flash fiction ) accepted in a new anthology hosted by Kevin J. Kennedy. Neither of us had ever written flash fiction before, let alone a drabble with its specific word length. Coming up with an idea, and then fitting it into exactly a hundred words was a fun challenge.
